                        <p>Pinal County has a documented shortage of psychiatric providers, and Apache Junction sits at the far edge of the Valley's network. Tiffany is licensed in Arizona and has over 30 years of experience treating ADHD, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, and addiction—so Apache Junction residents can get specialty mental health care without trekking to Mesa or Tempe.</p>
